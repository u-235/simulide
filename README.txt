SimulIDE
Electronic Circuit Simulator

SimulIDE is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator.
It's intended for general purpose electronics and microcontroller simulation, supporting PIC and AVR.
PIC simulation is provided by gpsim and avr simulation by simavr.

This is not an accurate simulator for circuit analisis, it aims to be the fast, simple and easy to use, so this means simple and not very accurate electronic models and limited features.

Intended for hobbist or students to learn and experiment with simple circuits.
RUNNING SimulIDE:

The folder "SimulIDE" contains all necessary to run the program, just run the executable.
(For PIC simulation in Linux gpsim must be installed on your system)
